# Add JAWCE as a dependency
In case you dont want to run the engine as a standalone service. You can add the engine as a dependency to your existing project to couple it together with your business logic.


In your `pom.xml` dependencies add the following

```xml
<!-- your other dependencies -->

<dependency>
    <groupId>zw.co.dcl.engine</groupId>
    <artifactId>whatsapp</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

Make sure you create a rest controller which handles 2 of the important logic
- webhook verification
- webhook payload


You can look at the logic for the default [webhook verification](https://github.com/DonnC/jawce/blob/2882dbd73a29657cc33785f95171070ad4e4f90f/src/main/java/zw/co/dcl/engine/whatsapp/controller/WebhookController.java#L21)
and [webhook payload](https://github.com/DonnC/jawce/blob/2882dbd73a29657cc33785f95171070ad4e4f90f/src/main/java/zw/co/dcl/engine/whatsapp/controller/WebhookController.java#L30) here.


> Take note to create an instance of `WhatsappEngineProcessor` which handles all necessary methods

Its advisable that you also implement your own Session Service from the [ISessionManager  interface.](https://github.com/DonnC/jawce/blob/main/src/main/java/zw/co/dcl/engine/whatsapp/service/iface/ISessionManager.java)
