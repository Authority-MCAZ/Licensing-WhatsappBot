# Prop

If you have been developing websites, you probably come across this word. Here, Props are custom variables that you can use however you'd like - to store data in the user session under that variable

## Defining a prop

To define a prop on a particular template

```yaml
1000:
  type: text
  prop: name
  message: "What is your name?"
  routes:
    "re:.*": next-stage
```

In the above, when user provides a response, it will be saved in the user session with the key `name`

You can then access this data later in your program by this key from the user session.

A helper endpoint to get user session data by key is defined and can be accessible via

```bash
$ curl GET http://localhost:8080/webhook/{user_mobile}/{session_key}
```

to get all user session data pass `session_key` as asterik `*`
