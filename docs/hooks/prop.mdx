# Prop

If you have been developing websites, you probably come across this word. Here, Props are custom variables that you can use however you'd like - to store data in the user session under that variable

The engine have a constant internal key for user props.

All props defined in templates are saved into a `Map` under the key **kProps**.


## Defining a prop

To define a prop on a particular template

```yaml
1000:
  type: text
  prop: userName
  message: "What is your name?"
  routes:
    "re:.*": next-stage
```

In the above, when user provides a response, it will be saved in the user session props under the key `userName`

# Get From Session
You can then access this data later in your program by the prop key from the user session.

A helper endpoint to get user session data by key is defined and can be accessible via

```
[GET request] http://localhost:8080/webhook/{user-mobile}/{session-key}
```

to get all user session data pass `session-key` as asterik `*`

# Save To Session
You can optionally add data to the user session via the endpoint

The request body is as below

```json
{
    "user": "user-mobile",
    "key": "data-key",
    "prop": false,
    "data": "dynamic-data-to-save"
}
```

> If `prop` is `true`, data will be treated like template prop and saved under kProps

```
[POST request] http://localhost:8080/webhook/session
```
