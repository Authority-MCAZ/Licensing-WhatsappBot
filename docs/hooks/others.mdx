# Other Hooks
In this section, will quickly go through the following *fields. They are not necessarily hooks.
- params
- routes

# Routes
A **required** field on each template. It defines where to go after the user respond.

You can define exact field mapping or regex using the prefix `re:` (*Java regex pattern*).

> Regex routes (with `re:`) are evaluated first before the non-regex mappings

If type is `button`, the response is always the button name you give under the buttons

```yaml
100:
  type: button
  message:
    body: "Sample button message"
    buttons:
      - btn1
      - Return
  routes:
    "btn1": 1000
    "return": "MAIN_MENU"
```

if type is `list`, the item id you give is the one matched under the routes field

```yaml
1000:
  type: list
  message:
    title: "Title"
    body: "List template message"
    button: "button"
    sections:
      "Section Title":
        0:
          title: Item 1
          description: My item desc
        "other":
          title: Other
  routes:
    0: 2000
    "other": 3000
```

You can make your regex matching as strict as you want. If there is no match under routes a default message is send to the user
saying that `Invalid response format, please try again`.

```yaml
"DOB_STAGE":
  type: text
  message:
   - "Kindly enter your D.O.B"
   - ""
   - "Format: _DD/MM/YYYY_"
  routes:
    "re:^(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])/(0[1-9]|1[0-2])/\\d{4}$": "NEXT_STAGE"
```
