# General Hooks
This section will show how the general hooks are processed, These hooks include:

- on-receive
- on-generate
- template
- middleware
- validator

Consider the example for `on-receive` below

## Example Hook: On-Receive

```yaml
1000:
  type: text
  on-receive: "rest:https://example.com/api/notify"
  message: "Type `yes` to receive a Slack notification from us"
  routes:
    "yes": "next-stage"
```

When user responds and `on-receive` is defined, the hook is processed.

To define *REST API* based hooks, prefix them with `rest:`

Each rest based hook must be a **POST** request which accepts a `HookArgs` object

Consider a sample python rest hook

```python
# ...

@app.post("/notify")
def slack_notify(args: HookArgs):
    print("Received args: {}".format(args))

    # assume user input slack id and its saved
    # in user session

    slack_id = get_data_from_session(
        user=args.channelUser.waId,
        data_key="slack_id"
    )

    # send notification via slack

    return args

# ...
```
