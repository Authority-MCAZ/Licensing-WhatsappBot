# General Hooks
This section will show how the general hooks are processed, These hooks include:

- on-receive
- on-generate
- template
- middleware
- validator


> Any hook can have other business logic in it e.g A template hook can return the required dynamic data but it may also have logic to do other 
> processes on it. E.g save some data to user session or call another service. A middleware hook might validate some input etc

Consider the example for `on-receive` below

> The example below works for `on-receive`, `on-generate`, `middleware`, `validator` hooks

## Example Hook: On-Receive

```yaml
1000:
  type: text
  on-receive: "rest:https://example.com/api/notify"
  message: "Type `yes` to receive a Slack notification from us"
  routes:
    "yes": "next-stage"
```

When user responds and `on-receive` is defined, the hook is processed.

To define *REST API* based hooks, prefix them with `rest:`

Each rest based hook must be a **POST** request which accepts a `HookArgs` object

Consider a sample rest hook

<CodeGroup title="on-receive hook: Notify">
```python
# ...
# using FAST API

# constant prop key in engine session
ENGINE_PROP_KEY = "kProps"

@app.post("/notify")
def slack_notify(args: HookArgs):
    print("Received args: {}".format(args))

    user_props_data = get_data_from_session(
        user=args.channelUser.waId,
        data_key=ENGINE_PROP_KEY
    )

    # assume there was a template that asked user for
    # their Slack Id and had a prop key of `slack_id`
    slack_response = notify_via_slack(slack_id=user_props_data.get('"slack_id"'))

    return args
```

 ```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/notify")
class SlackService {
    @PostMapping
    public HookArgsRest notify(@RequestBody HookArgsRest args) {
    //   ... handle send notification
      return args;
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
