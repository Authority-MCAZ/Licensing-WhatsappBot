# Add the engine as a dependency
In case you dont want to run the engine as a standalone service. You can add the engine as a dependency to your existing project to couple it together with your business logic.


In your `pom.xml` dependencies add the following

```xml
<!-- your other dependencies -->

<dependency>
    <groupId>zw.co.dcl.engine</groupId>
    <artifactId>whatsapp</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```
