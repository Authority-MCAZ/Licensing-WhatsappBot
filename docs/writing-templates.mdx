# Getting Started
**JAWCE** supports writing chatbot messages in [YAML](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-yaml) format. This means you can write your
conversation flows in a familiar format and it will be rendered on the WhatsApp channel. I chose YAML apart from JSON because it is strict üòè that's all.

Alongside this, you may notice the file extension for your templates is `.yaml` or  `.yml`. This is because they are both valid YAML file extensions üòê.

## Triggers

Most chatbots have a start word(s) or just a keyword that can trigger a certain flow to kick in. 
For example, most chatbots may trigger a **GREETING** message template when a user sends `start` or `hi` message. In this situation, you want the bot to respond back whenever user sends this messages.
These are the `triggers` as you may have expected.

Triggers are global and they are the ones to be evaluated first before any stages that you define in your `templates` folder.

```yaml
"MAIN_MENU": "re:^start$"
```

The triggers above mean that, whenever user types `start` -  render the **MAIN_MENU** template to user

To define `regex` triggers, always prefix them with `re:` Learn more under [Hooks](/hooks) section.

Its prefferable to have your triggers as exact regex to avoid unexpected responses üòï.

## Templates
These are the backbone of the engine. Whats is a chatbot if we dont have conversations with the users.

This is where you add your chatbot brains and define its conversation flow.

Templates are predictable, are defined in "STAGES" or "STEPS" or "FLOW" whatever you want to call it, to make it easy to know where to go from 1 conversation to another. There are a couple of `hooks` you can define on your template - will cover hooks in the next section. These hooks will extend the functionality of your template as you desire. There are different message types in WhatsApp [Message Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-messages).

The engine supports some type and some .. well you can contribute if progress is slow ü´£ ..

The engine currently supports the following types
- text
- button
- list
- flow
- dynamic - dynamically created template of any of the above types

### Example bot: Booking Chatbot

Imagine we have a chatbot which manages booking for a System demonstration to interested clients.

We can have a start menu (first step) as below
```yaml
"MAIN_MENU":
  type: button
  message:
    body: "Hi, I am JAWCE ü§ñ, your ERP System booking assistant.\n\nWhat would you like to do today?"
    buttons:
      - Book Demo
      - Help
  routes:
    "book demo": "BOOK_STAGE"
    "help": "HELP_MENU"
```

A lot is happening here, but lets break it down.

The `type` - specifies that this template should show as a button message on the end user.

The `message` - message to show the user, like a button body

The `buttons` - the buttons to show to the user which the user will select

The `routes` - to know where to go when user selects any of the button options we gave them. The routes maps the user response to the next stage defined in your `templates` folder.


<Tabs
  values={[
    { label: 'BOOK_STAGE', value: 'first' },
    { label: 'Start - 1000', value: 'second' },
    { label: 'Choose - 2000', value: 'third' },
    { label: 'End - 3000', value: 'forth' },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="first">
  ```yaml
"BOOK_STAGE":
    type: button
    message:
      body: "Kindly confirm your system demo booking request by clicking the start button"
      footer: ERP Demo
      buttons:
        - Start
        - Return
    routes:
      "start": 1000
      "return": "MAIN_MENU"
```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="second">
```yaml
1000:
    type: button
    prop: userSelectedErp
    message:
      body: "Great choice, select your ERP of choice"
      buttons:
        - ERPNext
        - SAP
        - Odoo
    routes:
      "re:.*": 2000
```
    </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="third">
```yaml
2000:
    type: text
    prop: userSelectedBookingDate
    message:
      - "Kindly provide your preferred demo date and time in 24hr format"
      - ""
      - "Format: _DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM_ e.g *23/05/2024 10:00*"
    routes:
      "re:.*": 3000
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="forth">
```yaml
3000:
    type: button
    message:
      body: "Your booking as been recorded. I will notify you 30mins before on your selected demo day üôÇ"
      buttons:
        - Menu
    routes:
      "menu": "MAIN_MENU"
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


By now you can picture what the above is doing. You can name your stages any way you want, numbers or text - your choice.

This will be the chatbot conversation brain and it will be hopping from 1 stage to the other as you define it üòÄ.
