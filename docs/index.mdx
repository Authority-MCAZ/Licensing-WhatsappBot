`JAWCE` is a free Open Source project, allowing you to create instant WhatsApp chatbot using the official WhatsApp Cloud API.

A project evolving social media chatbot is always an exciting project to do, especially using a platform which has won the hearts of many - WhatsApp, however creating a chatbot for WhatsApp has its challenges and is time consuming. Many common solutions to problems have to be duplicated, along with
dealing with overheads such as session.

In my experience developing WhatsApp chatbots, i had to reinvent the wheel, duplicate code and battle session management. One pain point was to manage multi-stage chatbot to give a seamless user experience which ended up taking most of my development time to make it work well by repeating logic and more.

I JAWCE to cut this development time and deliver almost-instant quick easy chatbots as well as advanced ones. I created it as an `Engine` so that its seperate from the actual chatbot logic so that i only focus on my chatbot business logic and not worry about the inner workings of WhatsApp and session itself which were a huge pain point.

Features include:

- [Hooks](/hooks): Extend or add custom functionality by means of hooks.
- [Templates](/writing-templates): Create template based message flows for your users.
- [Extendable](/extend): Add as dependency to your Java code and use it coupled with business logic.

Other useful features include:

- Configurable
- Support for WhatsApp Flows
- Message debounce to avoid processing repetitive webhook messages
