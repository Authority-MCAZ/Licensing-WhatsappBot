A project evolving social media chatbot is always an exciting project to do, however creating a chatbot for WhatsApp has its challenges and is time consuming. Many common solutions to problems have to be duplicated, along with
dealing with overheads such as session.

In my experience developing WhatsApp chatbots, I had to reinvent the wheel, duplicate code and battle session management. One pain point was to manage multi-stage chatbot to give a seamless user experience which ended up taking most of my development time to make it work well by repeating logic and more.

I developed **JAWCE** to cut this development time and deliver (almost) instant quick easy chatbots as well as advanced ones. 
I created it as an `Engine` so that its seperate from the actual chatbot logic. You will focus on the chatbot conversation flow and the business logic and leave the rest to the engine.

Features include:

- [Hooks](/hooks): Extend or add custom functionality by means of hooks.
- [Templates](/writing-templates): Create template based message flows for your users.
- [Extendable](/extend): Add as dependency to your Java code and use it coupled with business logic.

Other useful features include:

- Configurable
- Support for WhatsApp Flows
- Message debounce to avoid processing repetitive webhook messages

## Should I use JAWCE?

Certainly NOT ü´£ Its spaghetti code that just works - why should you? But thats good. If you find it helpful you can assist by contributing. Give it a try and let me know your experience.
