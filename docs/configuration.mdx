## Configuration


### Default configurations
The engine comes with default H2 embedded in-memory database which you can change to your preffered datasource in `application.yml`

Internally the engine uses a simple session manager: `ConcurrentMapCache` which resets everytime you restart the service.

For a persistant or more advanced session / cache manager consider using `HazelCast` or `Redis` for persistent cache or any of your preffered choice.

### Getting Started

Open the project with IntelliJ or any IDE of your choice and install the dependencies. This project uses `maven`.

The H2 Database name is `mem:JavaWhatsappEngineDb` but you can change this in the `application.yml`

Default running port is `8080`

Set your WhatsApp credentials in the database by making a POST request to

`http://localhost:8080/webhook/config`

```json
{
    "accessToken": "",
    "hubToken": "",
    "phoneNumberId": "",
    "apiVersion": "v18.0"
}
```

Thats all, you can now play around with your configured message templates and check your bot in action ðŸ™‚.
