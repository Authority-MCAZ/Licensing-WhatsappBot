# Contributing

Learn how to run JAWCE locally and help contribute to the project.

## Running locally

Firstly, fork the [https://github.com/invertase/docs.page](https://github.com/invertase/docs.page) repository.
Once forked, clone the repository locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:invertase/docs.page.git
```

Open the project with IntelliJ or any IDE or choice and install the dependencies.

It uses H2 embedded database for quick testing. Database name is `mem:JavaWhatsappEngineDb` but you can change this in the `application.yml`


Before running, you must have WhatsApp credentials all set

You can set the credentials for the engine by making a POST via REST API to

`http://localhost:port/webhook/config`

```json
{
    "accessToken": "",
    "hubToken": "",
    "phoneNumberId": "",
    "apiVersion": "v18.0"
}
```
