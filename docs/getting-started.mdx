# Getting Started

The JAWCE engine reads your conversation flow (`templates`) directly from the project `resources\templates` and `resources\triggers` folder. To get started:

1. Create a `templates` directory in `..\resources\templates` if it does not exist.
2. Create a `triggers` directory in `..\resources\triggers` if it does not exist.
3. Add some templates files in the `.yaml` format to define your bot message flows.
4. Add a `trigger.yaml` inside the `..\resources\triggers` to define your bot message global triggers.


Before running, you must have WhatsApp credentials all set
