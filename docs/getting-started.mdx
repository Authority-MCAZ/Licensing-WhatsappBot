# Demo
If you successfully run this project, your simple chatbot will be available like below

<Video muted autoPlay src="/assets/demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

# Getting Started

> The engine comes with sample templates - you can set your credentials and if all goes well, start your chatbot with `start`

The JAWCE engine reads your conversation flow (`templates`) directly from the project `resources\templates` and `resources\triggers` folder. To get started:

1. Create a `templates` directory in `..\resources\templates` if it does not exist.
2. Create a `triggers` directory in `..\resources\triggers` if it does not exist.
3. Add some templates files in the `.yaml` format to define your bot message flows.
4. Add a `trigger.yaml` inside the `..\resources\triggers` to define your bot message global triggers.


Before running, you must have WhatsApp credentials all set

> Checkout the getting started to [WhatsApp Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started/).


## Running locally
If running on different port, use your custom port in place of *8080*

The default engine uses file based **H2 database**. The file is saved under `./data/JavaWhatsappEngineDb` when the engine starts.

You can access the H2 console by opening your browser at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`. Use the config as below to connect.

After the project is up and running, set your credentials by making a post request or add the data in the database manually

POST: `http://localhost:port/webhook/config`

```json
{
    "accessToken": "",
    "hubToken": "jawce-hub-token-123",
    "phoneNumberId": "",
    "apiVersion": "v18.0"
}
```

If all goes well, **restart** the service.

## Meta Developer
I assume you already set your meta / facebook / whatsapp account and have access to the developer portal of your application

When the project is running successfully, you can use **NGROK** to tunnel the engine service to enable WhatsApp to send webhook request to the engine

```bash
$ ngrok http 8080
```

The webhook url will be accessible on `https://ngrok-url/webhook` which you can use to configure on your meta developer application portal as below
